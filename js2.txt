Today we will understand how we can run javascript code .(indirectly what softwares are required for running js code )

There are couple of methods for running js code locally on your system,but two of them mainly used are -

1. Running code in browser with HTML code like google crome, firefox, microsoft edge, Opera, Apple's Safari etc.

2. Running code with of help js- engines by downloading them . We have nodejs , Deno  runtime of js application/code.
This is same like we have complier for c/c++ and jvm for java , python3 or python2 for python code.

If you're wondering how a browser can run js code ,then the answer is they have their own built-in engines for js .fun fact nodejs runtime is built on the top of v8 js engine which is used by crome .(you can also search more about js history ) Hope you will find this session good.
