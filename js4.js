// *L-5 Declaring variables and Data types in js*

// JavaScript variables-
// Those elements which are used to store data values in programs.

// JavaScript uses the keywords *var, let and const* to declare variables.

// An equal sign is used to assign values to variables.

// In this example, x is defined as a variable. Then, x is assigned (given) the value 6:

// let x;
// x = 6;

// Data types : data types are used in context of  a variable it's important know that element is of which data type so that we can perform operations on it.

// Some data types are : number , string , Boolean , undefined ,Symbols , Object , arrays etc.

// *you don't have much worry about arrays and objects we will see them in details later*
